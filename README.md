## Task

This is the source code for [2020 SIGMOD Programming Contest](http://www.inf.uniroma3.it/db/sigmod2020contest/task.html). We aim to use a Rule-based method to solve the entity resolution problem in a real-world dataset.

We constructed two realization of the solution in c++ and python seperately.
